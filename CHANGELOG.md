# Change Log

## Latest

* Enhancement: Full Python 3 compatibility - migrated entire codebase from Python 2 to Python 3
* Enhancement: Comprehensive fractional frame rate support (23.976, 29.97, 59.94 fps) for broadcast standards
* Enhancement: Added broadcast shortcuts (--fps-ntsc-film, --fps-ntsc, --fps-pal) to test sequence generator
* Enhancement: Added professional resolution presets (--size-4k-full, --size-hd-1080) for common formats
* Enhancement: Added complete format presets (--preset-1080p59.94, --preset-cinema-4k) for one-command generation
* Enhancement: Implemented exact rational arithmetic throughout for frame-perfect timing accuracy
* Enhancement: Added support for fields (as opposed to frames) to the test sequence generator
* Enhancement: Added support to test sequence generator for skipping generating frames already
  on the disk, to allow resumption of lengthy generation jobs if interrupted.
* Improvement: Fixed all deprecated unittest assertion methods (assertEquals â†’ assertEqual)
* Improvement: Updated all imports to Python 3 standards
* Improvement: Fixed tuple unpacking syntax for Python 3 compatibility
* Improvement: Added comprehensive test coverage with 168+ tests using pytest and Hypothesis
* Documentation: Added fractional frame rate guide (test_sequence_gen/README_FRACTIONAL.md)
* Documentation: Added bit timing design documentation with visual diagrams
* Documentation: Updated all code to use Apache License 2.0 headers consistently

## 0.3 : (02 Sep 2015) Flash/beep detection improvements, customisable test sequences and various bugfixes

_**NOTE:** Not backward compatible with JSON metadata files generated by the
test sequence generator in earlier versions (due to pulse detection
enhancements)._

* Enhancement: Flash/beep detection algorithm improved. Test sequence
  generator modified to add extra metadata fields that describe the duration
  of the beeps and flashes in the test sequence.
* Enhancement: Added ability to add custom labels and colours to generated
  test sequences.
* Enhancement: Added ability to control how long capturing lasts using
  `--measureSecs` command line option
* Bugfix: Failure when measuring not using LIGHT_0 input
* Bugfix: FFMPEG was adding timing offset to audio (relative to video) in MP4s.
  Added offset via command line options to compensate.
* Bugfix: `exampleCsaTester.py` was providing incorrect `presentationStatus`
* Bugfix: Corrected detection of ffmpeg in test sequence encoding script

## 0.2 : (09 Mar 2015) Added TV measuring

* Added ability to measure timing accuracy of a TV Device.
* Various refactorings and cleanups

## 0.1 : initial release
