        The algorithm object must have an onClockAdjusted method that can be overriden or replaced
        with the same arguments as the one defined for :class:`~dvbcss.protocol.client.wc.algorithm.LowestDispersionCandidate`.
        
        Works by replacing the onClockAdjusted method in the algorithm object,
        so beware if using other code that tries to do the same.
