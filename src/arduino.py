"""\
This python library handles communication with the Arudino Due microcontroller
via its "native" USB port. The arduino must be running the code supplied in
the "hardware" directory of this project.

Requires 'pyserial' (can be installed from the python package index using PIP).


Usage
-----

The :func:`connect` function returns a handle to a file object for communicating with
the Arduino.

The following functions are then used to control the Arduino:

* :func:`samplePinDuringCapture` ... enable one of the input pins to be captured
* :func:`prepareToCapture`       ... query the arduino to find out how much data will be captured
* :func:`capture`                ... initiate sampling of the enabled input pins
* :func:`bulkTransfer`           ... retrieve captured data

Once you have finished communicating with the Arduino, just close the file
handle.

All these functions require that you pass a :mod:`dvbcss.clock` object as well
as the file handle. This is because a simple NTP request-response style time
synchronisation measurement is performed for every command that is sent.

It is this process that makes it possible to translate the time the arduino
reports that it started and finished sampling into a time relevant to the
PC running this python code.



Internals
---------

Some constants are defined that contain the string to be sent to
give the Arduino a particular command.

* CMD_BULK
* CMD_CAPTURE
* CMD_PREPARE_TO_CAPTURE
* CMD_TIMEONLY

Various functions in this module will parse bytes received via the file handle
appropriate to the particular command used. Some functions will also send
the command. See individual documentation for each.

    The number of millisecond blocks the Arduino captures
    depends how many pins are requested to be sampled (see samplePinDuringCapture() ).

    One millisecond block will hold the high and low values sampled
    for each pin, within one millisecond.  With 4 pins enabled, one
    millisecond block will hold 8 bytes.

    Each pin's data contributes 2 bytes per block.

    One pin's data block is stored in ascending byte addresses
    as "high" value, then "low" value, as observed over a millisecond.

    For each enabled pin, the data blocks within the millisecond block are organised so that, if pin A < pin B,
    A's data block appears before B's in the millisecond block.

    In response, the arduino reads the local time (using micros) and remembers this microsecond value as the start time
    and immediately starts capturing the sample data.

    Once complete, the finish time (in microseconds) is measured.

    The Arduino then sends back the start time when data capture commenced,
    followed by the finish time, followed by the number of millisecond blocks captured.
